## Installation

### Requirements

The installation of ELMO is possible on operating systems such as recent Windows versions (e.g. Windows 10/11) and the most common Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian).
Following conditions are required for installation:
- PHP ‚â• 8.2 and ‚â§ 8.4
	- incl. a webserver able to perform PHP operations (such as Apache or Nginx)
	- extensions needed: XSL, ZIP
- MySQL (for further requirements, see: [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing-and-configuration.html)) or MariaDB

### Quick installation guide

1. Ensure a development environment with PHP >8.2 and a MySQL or MariaDB server.
2. The XSL and ZIP extensions for PHP must be installed and enabled.
3. Don't forget to start Apache and MySQL.
4. Create a new empty sql database in (e.g. using phpMyAdmin) and copy the name of the database.
5. Copy the content of the file `env.sample` into a new file `.env` and adjust the settings for the database connection. (skip for default)
6. Copy the content of the file `choice.sample.php` into a new file `choice.php`. (skip for default)
7. For the automatically generated time zone selection, create a free API key at [timezonedb.com](https://timezonedb.com/) and enter it into the newly created `.env`.
8. Create a Google Maps JS API key and paste it into the `.env` file as well.
9. Copy all files from this repository into the `htdocs` or `www` folder of your web server.
10. In this folder run `npm install` via bash.
11. There you run `composer install`. 
12. Access `install.html` via the browser and choose to install with or without test datasets. Depending on your choice, the database tables will be created in your database, as well as 5 test datasets.
13. Delete `install.php` and `install.html` after successfully creating the database.
14. The metadata editor is now accessible in the browser via `localhost/directoryname`.
15. Adjust settings in `.env` (see [Settings Section](#settings)).

### Installation via Docker
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `docker compose build` in the cloned project folder via bash.
4. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the container.
5. This directory contains .env_sample that you will need to rename to .env. Please feel free to change the credentials in it.
	Please mind that: 
	- Environment variables for database setup only apply on first container startup. If volumes persist, old configs stay alive.
	- Use `docker-compose down -v` to reset the database when updating credentials.
6. Docker Environment Setup üê≥

This section outlines the automatic processes handled by the Docker environment for ELMO. While not strictly necessary for basic usage, understanding these steps is crucial for modifying behavior or troubleshooting.

**1. `docker-compose.yaml`**
- Configures and orchestrates two primary services:
  - `db`: Built from a MariaDB image.
  - `web`: Built from the `Dockerfile`.
- Volume mount: links file in the container and on the host filesystem.

**2. `Dockerfile`** 
- **Base Image:** Installs `php 8.4-apache` and essential dependencies, including the database client.
- **Project Copy:** Copies the entire project directory into the container's root (`/var/www/html`), setting appropriate ownership for the standard Apache user (`www-data`). If you don't want something to be copied into container, include it into .dockerignore (performance might be affected)
- **Entrypoint:** Executes the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script.

**3. `docker-entrypoint.sh`** 
- **Database Setup:** Responsible for initializing the database structure by running `install.php`.
- **Idempotency:** Utilizes a `FLAG_FILE` to ensure the database setup runs only once. If this file exists, the installation process is skipped.
- **Installation Options for `install.php`:**
  - `basic` (default): Creates only the database structure and inserts lookup data.
  - `complete`: Creates the database structure, inserts lookup data, *and* populates the database with exemplar (test) data. This is controlled by the `INSTALL_ACTION` environment variable (e.g., `INSTALL_ACTION=complete`).

---

**Important Notes for Developers:**

* **Full Reset for Dockerfile/Entrypoint Changes:**
    To apply changes made to `Dockerfile` or `docker-entrypoint.sh`, a full reset of the Docker containers is required:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    ```
* **Applying Other Changes:**
    For changes to project files (which are copied, not mounted as volumes), you need to rebuild the service:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This rebuilds the `web` service (and any other services specified in `docker-compose.yaml` that depend on the build context), ensuring your updated project files are included in the new container image.

  ### Detailed example installation on Windows 10/11
  </summary>
  <details>
  This section will further explain the installation of the metadata editor with the help of a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to install the metadata editor on Windows 10/11 using PHP and MySQL. For a local development environment, localhost-based access to the server is usually sufficient.
  #### 1. Setting up the development environment
  - Download and run the installer from the official [PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) (PHP > 8.2).
  - Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) or MariaDB.
  - Install and enable the XSL and ZIP extensions for PHP. In order to do that, open the `php.ini` file and uncomment the line for the required extensions.
  #### 2. Starting Apache and MySQL
  - If you're using an all-in-one solutions such as XAMPP or WampServer, you can start Apache directly from the XAMPP or WampServer control panel.
  - Alternatively, you can manually start Apache by navigating to the `bin` directory of Apache (e.g., `C:\xampp\apache\bin`) and running `httpd.exe`.
  #### 3. Creating an empty SQL database
  - Using phpMyAdmin: If you're using XAMPP or WampServer, phpMyAdmin is already installed. You can access it by going to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
  - Create a new database and remember the name of it, as you'll need it later in the next step.
  - Alternatively, using the Windows PowerShell: 
    - Start MySQL in the Shell while being in your SQL directory: `mysql -u root -p`
    - Create a database: `CREATE DATABASE your_database;`
    - Create a new MySQL-user for the installation: `CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`
    - Granting rights to this user: `GRANT CREATE ON your_database.* TO 'username'@'localhost';` and save with `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
    - Optional: confirm the creation of the database while being logged in as the new user: `SHOW DATABASES;`
  #### 4. Setting up the `.env` file
  - Download all files from this repository into the `htdocs`or`www`folder of your webserver.
  - Create `.env`:
     - Copy the entire contents of `.env.sample` which is located in the first level of the ELMO repository and save it as `.env` in the same directory.
  - Adjust the database connection:
    - Open the `.env` file with a text editor and modify the database connection settings according to your database name, user, password and host. The default MySQL user ist 'root'. Change this to the MySQL-user you just created in step 3. The host value typically remains as 'localhost'.
  #### 5. Setting up the application
  - Access the installation script in your browser as follows: `http://localhost/your_directory/install.html`. This script will automatically create the required tables in the database you specified in step 3. In addition, three test datasets are installed through `install.html` if you chose this option.
  #### 6. Delete installation files
  - Please delete `install.php` and `install.html` after successfully creating the database.
  #### 7. (Optional) Creating an API key for the automatically generated time zone selection
  - Sign up for a free API key at [timezonedb.com](https://timezonedb.com/). After registration, you should receive an email with your account data including your API key.
  - Insert your API key in `.env` in the according line.
  #### 8. Creating a Google Maps JS API key
  - Get a Google Maps JS API key via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). To do this, create a project, enable the Google Maps JavaScript API and get your API key.
  - Insert your Google Maps API key in the corresponding line in the `.env`file. 
  #### 9. Accessing the metadata editor
  - After the installation is complete, you should be able to access the metadata editor in your browser at `http://localhost/your_directory`.
  - Settings may be modified in `choice.php`.

  #### Choosing the version
  ELMO is used in different research fields. Every version can be deployed out-of-the-box by providing a `CONFIG_VERSION`:
    - **Generic ELMO** for the widest variety of research data. Represents the DataCite variables. `CONFIG_VERSION = generic`
    - **ELMO MSL** is the generic ELMO, additionally provided with [EPOS Multi-Scale Labs](https://epos-msl.uu.nl/)
    - **ELMO GEM** is an adaptation of ELMO for model publications on the [ICGEM](https://icgem.gfz.de). Provided with additional form groups, core form groups adjusted.
  The `CONFIG_VERSION` can be specified inside the `docker-compose.yml`. Speecifying the `CONFIG_VERSION` makes container immutable and thus production-ready. When developing locally, you can switch the form groups in `choice.php`.

  For a more custom build of ELMO, a new `CONFIG_VERSION` can be added to the /envs folder and `docker-entrypoint.sh`

  ## Data validation
  </summary>

The metadata editor has some mandatory fields which are necessary for the submission of data. These include the following fields:
- **Publication Year**, **Resource Type**, **Language of dataset**, **Title**, **Title Type**(_not for the first (main) title!_), **Author Lastname**, **Author Firstname**,**Contact Person Lastname**, **Contact Person Firstname**, **Contact Person Email address**, **Descriptions Abstract**, **Date created**, **Min Latitude**, **Min Longitude**, **STC Description**, **STC Date Start**, **STC Date End** und **STC Timezone**.‚ùó


The other fields are optional and are used to further enrich the data set with metadata. The following fields are optional:
- **DOI**, **Version**, **Rights**, **Author ORCID**, **Author Affiliation**, **Contact Person Website**, **Contact Person Affiliation**, **Contributor ORCID**, **Contributor Role**, **Contributor Lastname**, **Contributor Firstname**, **Contributor Affiliation**, **Contributor Organisation Name**, **Contributor Organisation Role**, **Contributor Organisation Affiliation**, **Description Methods**, **Description TechnicalInfo**, **Description Other**, **Thesaurus Keywords**, **MSL Keywords**, **Free Keywords**, **STC Max Latitude**, **STC Max Longitude**, **STC Time Start**, **STC Time End**, **Related work all fields** and **Funding Reference all fields**.‚úÖ


In certain cases, some subfields within a formgroup become mandatory. This affects the following fields:

Formgroup Contributors:
  - **Contributor Role**, **Contributor Lastname** and **Contributor Firstname** become mandatory, if one of the Contributor Person fields is filled in
  - **Contributor Organisation Name** and **Contributor Organisation Role** become mandatory, if one of the Contributor Organisation fields is filled in (this includes **Contributor Organisation Affiliation**)

Formgroup Spatial and Temporal Coverages: 
  - Per default, no specification of any fields is required here when leaving all fields empty. Filling in any of the optional fields results in a change of mandatory fields.
  - **Min Latitude**, **Min Longitude**, **Description**, **Date Start**, **Date End** and **Timezone** will become mandatory, if only one field of the formgroup gets filled in 
  - **Max Latitude** becomes mandatory, if **Max Longitude** is filled in and vice versa
  - **Time Start** becomes mandatory, if **Time End** is filled in and vice versa

Formgroup Related works:
  - **Related work all Fields** becomes mandatory fields, if one of the fields is filled in
  Formgroup Funding Reference:
  - **Funder** becomes mandatory, if **Grant Number** or **Grant Name** are specified

As for the ICGEM implementation, more required variables are added to ensure a full description of a Global Gravitational Model:
- **Model Type**, **Mathematical Representation**, **Model Name**

Meanwhile these variables from required list are not required to publish a GGM:
- **Resource Type** *(can be mapped to Model)*, **Spatio-temporal Coverage** *(can be mapped to global coverage)*
