                        <h5>1. Scope of Personal Data Processing</h5>
                        <p>In general, the GFZ only processes personal data collected from users insofar as this is
                            necessary to provide a functional website with the relevant content and services. As a
                            rule,
                            personal data provided by users is only processed with the respective user's consent.
                            Exceptions
                            apply in cases where the user’s prior consent cannot be obtained on factual grounds and
                            statutory regulations permit the processing of personal data.</p>

                        <h5>2. Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data</h5>
                        <p>The following legal bases apply to the processing of personal data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR:</strong> Consent of the data subject for the processing
                                of
                                their
                                personal data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR:</strong> Processing necessary for the performance of a
                                contract
                                to which the data subject is a party, or for taking steps at the request of the data
                                subject
                                prior to entering into a contract.</li>
                            <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR:</strong> Processing necessary for compliance with a legal
                                obligation to which the GFZ is subject.</li>
                            <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR:</strong> Processing necessary for the purposes of the
                                legitimate
                                interests pursued by the GFZ or a third party, provided these interests are not
                                outweighed
                                by the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>3. Data Erasure and Storage Period</h5>
                        <p>The data subject's personal data is erased or blocked as soon as the purpose for which it
                            was
                            stored ceases to apply. Personal data may also be stored if specified by European or
                            national
                            legislators in EU regulations, laws, or other provisions to which the data controller is
                            subject. In such instances, personal data is blocked or erased when the retention period
                            specified in the applicable legislation expires, unless it has to be retained for longer
                            in

                            purposes. The above-named purposes also constitute the GFZ’s legitimate interest in

                        ELMO is a web application to submit scientific datasets to be stored in the GFZ Data
                        Services
                        database for publishing them. If a data subject contacts the controller using the meta data
                        submission application, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically
                        stored.<br>
                        To successfully submit scientific datasets to GFZ Data Services, the data subject has to
                        provide
                        some additional personal data (e.g., name of authors and co-authors, name and email address
                        of a
                        contact person) to allow correct citation of those datasets in the scientific community.
                        This
                        information will be made available to the public after the submission process through

                        metadata (in XML or JSON format and via the GFZ Data Services website). This is a

                        scientific publishing. Scientific data publications including the aforementioned personal
                        data
                        may be consumed by third parties (e.g., libraries, data portals) using the GFZ Data

                        those
                        datasets in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for
