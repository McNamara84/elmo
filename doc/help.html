                    <p>
                        A contributor institution is an organisation responsible for collecting, managing, distributing,
                        or otherwise contributing to the development of the resource. To add more than one contributor,
                        use the "add" button on the right.

                    <p>
                        With <code>Contributing Institution(s)</code> you have the possibility to acknowledge additional
                        persons or institutions related to the dataset which you would normally not mention as authors.
                        These are not named in the citation but are always related to the dataset and findable just as
                        all the other metadata fields.

                            from unauthorized access, is stored in accordance with industry standards, and is

                            was derived from a laboratory, please include the name of the laboratory (with
                            affiliation) as contributor with the role “HostingInstitution”. There may be two hosting

                            full, specific character string to data clients, provide metadata back to the Data Cite

                            operate at a narrower level of scope; may or may not hold less administrative
                            responsibility than a project team.

                        The mathematical representation of a gravity field model refers to the set of functions used to express the gravitational potential, which are solutions of Laplace’s equation in a given coordinate system. The coordinate system determines the type of harmonics — spherical or ellipsoidal — and thus defines the mathematical form of the model.

                    <p>
                        All models on the ICGEM are published in the ICGEM file format. 
                        See description at https://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/docs/ICGEM-Format-2023.pdf

                        This field is mandatory. To support time-limited validity periods for time-varying coefficients, 
                        a new parameter has been introduced: format=icgem2.0.

                        Note: You cannot mix coefficients formatted as icgem1.0 and icgem2.0. 
                        Please ensure all model files use the same format version.

                        Static and temporal models produced based on direct gravity observations 
                        (for instance, from satellite gravity missions) have the product type "gravity field".

                        If the model is topographic and was produced using forward modelling, 
                        then the product type is "topographic gravity field".
